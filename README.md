A state-of-the-art 3D mesh reconstruction application powered by TripoSF (Triplane-based Sparse 3D Foundation) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) technology. This app transforms low-quality, corrupted, or poorly structured 3D meshes into high-quality, clean reconstructions using advanced AI techniques.

## What is 3D Mesh Reconstruction?

### Understanding 3D Meshes
A 3D mesh is a digital representation of a 3D object composed of:
- **Vertices**: Points in 3D space (x, y, z coordinates)
- **Faces**: Triangular surfaces connecting vertices  
- **Edges**: Lines connecting vertices

Think of it as a wireframe model - like a 3D car made of thousands of small triangles connected together.

### What "Reconstruction" Means
Reconstruction involves:
1. Taking an existing 3D mesh (potentially low-quality, corrupted, or poorly structured)
2. Using AI to learn its essential geometric features
3. Generating a new, improved version of the same object

It's like having an AI "understand" what the 3D object should look like and recreating it with superior quality.

## How It Works: The VAE Approach

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Technology
The app uses a sophisticated VAE with two main components:

1. **Encoder**: Compresses input meshes into compact "latent" representations
2. **Decoder**: Reconstructs high-quality meshes from these compressed representations

**Process Flow:**
- **Encoder**: Takes a 3D mesh ‚Üí creates a "DNA code" capturing its essence
- **Decoder**: Takes this "DNA code" ‚Üí rebuilds an improved 3D mesh

### Technical Pipeline

1. **Mesh Normalization**
   - Centers objects in 3D space
   - Scales to consistent size (fits in -0.5 to +0.5 cube)
   - Ensures uniform orientation
   - *Like putting photos in same-size frames, all right-side up*

2. **Sparse Voxel Conversion**
   - Converts meshes to 3D pixel grids (voxels)
   - Uses sparse representation (only stores occupied voxels)
   - Creates uniform, AI-friendly format
   - *Like converting sculptures to LEGO blocks - only remembering filled positions*

3. **AI Reconstruction**
   - Analyzes ~4 million surface sample points
   - Extracts important geometric patterns
   - Compresses to 8-dimensional shape "essence"
   - Generates new mesh from learned features

## Key Features

### Single File Processing
- **Clean Sequential Organization**: Files saved in numbered subfolders
  ```
  outputs/0001/0001_converted.obj
  outputs/0001/0001_normalized.obj  
  outputs/0001/0001_reconstructed.obj
  ```
- **Format Support**: OBJ and GLB files (GLB auto-converted to OBJ)
- **Robust Conversion**: Multiple fallback strategies for problematic files

### Batch Processing
- **Folder Processing**: Handle entire directories of mesh files
- **Organized Output**: Each file gets its own subfolder
  ```
  outputs/filename/filename_converted.obj
  outputs/filename/filename_normalized.obj
  outputs/filename/filename_reconstructed.obj
  ```
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time processing status
- **Skip Existing**: Option to skip already processed files

### Advanced Settings
- **Pruning**: Recommended for open-surface objects
- **Sample Points**: 819K to 8M points (more = better complex shape handling)
- **Seed Control**: Reproducible results with randomization option
